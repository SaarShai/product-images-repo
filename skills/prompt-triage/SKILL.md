# prompt-triage — bypass opus for simple tasks

## Problem

Heavy default model (opus, high-effort) burns tokens deciding what model a task needs. Many tasks — wiki notes, one-line fixes, factual lookups — don't need opus.

## Approach (3-layer)

### Layer 1: pre-model hook (`UserPromptSubmit`)

`tools/hook.sh` runs BEFORE main model sees prompt. Calls `tools/classify.py`:
- **Length gate** (0ms) — prompts >1500 chars never get a cheap-route directive (`AGENTS_TRIAGE_LENGTH_GATE` to tune). Long briefs are the main model's job.
- **Regex fast-path** (<5ms) matches known patterns.
- **Ollama fallback** (<1.5s) — local small model classifies if regex uncertain. Model auto-resolves from installed tags (preference order in `PREFERRED_MODELS`; pin with `AGENTS_TRIAGE_OLLAMA_MODEL`). First call of a session may miss while the model cold-loads (`keep_alive=2h` keeps it warm after).
- **Fail-closed** — a prompt carrying complex-work hints with no LLM available defers to the main model; no directive is emitted below 0.7 confidence.
- **Context guard** (0ms) — prompts referencing the current session/conversation ("what we built", "this suite") get NO directive: a fresh subagent cannot see chat history, so any verdict just forces the main model to evaluate-and-override.
- **Routing targets** — in-platform small models (haiku/sonnet tiers in Claude Code) plus `glm-executor` (GLM via z.ai) for bounded, self-contained content tasks only (summarize / classify / extract / rewrite over supplied content — cheap, 1M ctx, but blind to chat history). Local Ollama models are never auto-routed; manual dispatch only.

Outputs JSON + directive block appended to context:

```json
{"tier": "simple|medium|hard",
 "agent": "wiki-note|quick-fix|research-lite|general-purpose|none",
 "model": "haiku|sonnet|opus",
 "confidence": 0-1,
 "reason": "...",
 "gate": "per-agent acceptance criterion",
 "lean_context": [...]}
```

- **Acceptance gate** — every routed directive names what the subagent's
  output must show before the main model accepts it (quick-fix: edited hunk +
  named check green; research-lite: ≥1 cited source; …). A dispatch without a
  pass condition is malformed. (Adopted 2026-07-01 from
  [blader/arbitrage](https://github.com/blader/arbitrage).)
- **Two-strike escalation** — gate fails → ONE retry with concrete corrective
  feedback → then the main model takes over, salvaging partial output.
- **Observed, not predicted** — the main model may override the directive only
  after an observed gate failure, never predicted difficulty ("this needs my
  judgment"). The user can pre-empt with `NO TRIAGE`; the model cannot.

Model fields (`haiku|sonnet|opus`) are Claude Code **tier aliases** — the host resolves them to its newest model of each tier. On other hosts, map them to that host's tier equivalents per [`skills/_shared/ORCHESTRATION.md`](../_shared/ORCHESTRATION.md).

### Layer 2: main model sees directive, dispatches

Main model reads `⚡ [prompt-triage] ...` block → emits `Task(subagent_type, model, prompt)` immediately. Minimal thinking because the directive already specifies what to do.

Full opus bypass isn't possible (the host always routes through main), but the directive keeps thinking budget near zero on simple tasks.

### Layer 3: specialized subagents

Six bundled agents, each minimal-context:
- **wiki-note** (haiku) — repo-local wiki edits only.
- **quick-fix** (haiku) — small scoped edits, one Bash verify max.
- **glm-executor** (haiku coordinator) — bounded summarize/classify/extract/rewrite over supplied content, routed to GLM via z.ai. Triage routes here for self-contained content tasks, especially large-input ones.
- **local-ollama** (haiku coordinator) — shells out to local Ollama models. Manual dispatch only — triage never routes here (2026-06-12 policy).
- **research-lite** (haiku) — ≤5 web calls, ≤800-word output.
- **kaggle-feeder** (haiku) — archived Kaggle eval pipeline maintainer.

## Install

Claude Code:
```bash
bash skills/prompt-triage/tools/install.sh
```

Wires:
- skill → `.claude/skills/prompt-triage/`
- agent defs → `.claude/agents/`
- `UserPromptSubmit` hook → `.claude/settings.json`

## Override

Type `NO TRIAGE` anywhere in the prompt → hook exits silently → main model handles normally.

## Environment vars

- `AGENTS_TRIAGE_NO_OLLAMA=1` — skip Ollama fallback, regex-only.
- `AGENTS_TRIAGE_OLLAMA_MODEL=<tag>` — pin the fallback model (default: auto-resolve from `ollama /api/tags`).
- `AGENTS_TRIAGE_LENGTH_GATE=<chars>` — long-prompt hard gate (default 1500).

## Known failure modes

1. False-positive classification → wrong subagent → gate fails → two-strike ladder (one fed-back retry, then main takes over salvaging partial output). Bounded wasted round-trips.
2. Ollama down → regex-only, and complex-hinted prompts fail CLOSED (defer to main model) rather than emitting a cheap route.
3. Adversarial prompt ("this is simple: [complex thing]") → mis-routes. Mitigation: main can override directive.
4. Subagent can't escalate mid-task → returns "escalate" and stops; main model applies the two-strike ladder from there.
5. *(fixed 2026-06-12)* Hardcoded fallback tag rotted (model uninstalled) → every LLM fallback silently failed for weeks; complex prompts fell through to a still-emitted cheap route. Fixes: tag auto-resolution, fail-closed, <0.7-confidence silence, 1500-char length gate, `test_classify.py` regression lock.
