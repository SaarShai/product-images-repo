# EVAL — `semantic-diff`

## Static cost (measured)

| field | tokens / size |
|---|---|
| description (always resident) | **80 tokens** (348 chars) |
| body (loaded on trigger)      | **427 tokens** (1714 chars) |
| tools/ payload                 | 150671.3 KB |
| model pin                      | `any` |
| effort pin                     | `low` |

agentskills.io budget reference: description ≤ 1,536 chars (1% of a 200K context window).

## Methodology

- Sample size: N=3-10 local smoke; N≥50 on Kaggle T4 for any >20% savings claim.
- Tasks: 3–5 representative prompts in `eval/tasks/semantic-diff.yaml`.
- Backends supported: `ollama`, `anthropic`, `mimo`, `mlx` (`--backend` arg).
- Judge: Xiaomi MiMo via `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1` (preferred for quality) or local Ollama.
- Rubric: per-task rubric embedded in the YAML.

## Moved from SKILL.md (2026-06-12 SkillReducer-criteria audit)

_Provenance/rationale below is maintainer context, not runtime instruction — relocated so the lazy-loaded body stays actionable._

## Lineage

Inspired by cocoindex-code (AST MCP, claims 70% reduction + 80-90% cache hit). Our scope is narrower (file re-read diff, not full codebase index) and our measurements are repeatable on the published dataset.

## Measured gain (2026-06-13, `eval/gains.py`)

**97.3% fewer tokens** re-reading a 446-line file after a 2-function edit (4,672→127 est tokens), **break-even after R*=2 re-reads** vs naive full re-read — confirms the AST-node-diff savings claim deterministically. tree_sitter-guarded.
