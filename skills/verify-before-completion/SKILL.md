# Verify Before Completion

Rule: evidence before claims.

> "If you have a fast, deterministic, agent-runnable pass/fail signal for the bug, you will find the cause. If you don't have one, no amount of staring at code will save you."  — *mattpocock/skills/engineering/diagnose*

The same applies to "done": without a fresh, runnable signal that proves the work is correct, "done" is a guess.

Before any completion/success claim:
1. Identify the command, inspection, or checklist that proves it.
2. Run or perform it fresh.
3. Read the output or result.
4. Re-read the ORIGINAL ask (or the plan's `done means:` block) and check each criterion — code-level green is not goal-level done.
5. Report the exact verification and any remaining risk.

Do not claim:
- tests pass without a fresh test run
- lint/build is clean without running it
- bug is fixed without reproducing the original symptom or a regression test
- delegated work is correct without inspecting result/diff
- ship/merge-ready without Live Proof: exercise the changed path on the real built artifact or service — a mock or simulation does not count

When dispatching verification to a subagent: mid-tier model (sonnet-class) with read-only tools is the default — verifying is cheaper than making; escalate only when the artifact demands frontier reasoning.

If verification is impossible, say what was not verified and why.

## Harvest the learning (before you call it done)

Completion is also the moment experience compounds. Before the final claim, decide whether to harvest with this **one-line test**:

> **Harvest IFF the task produced a _durable, project-specific_ lesson you would want a FUTURE session to recall.**

**Fire the harvest** — write the lesson to [`wiki-memory`](../wiki-memory/SKILL.md) via [`write-gate`](../write-gate/SKILL.md) — when ANY of these is true:
- **failure / bug** hit and fixed → the prevention rule;
- **feedback / correction** received (user, review, red test) → the corrected rule + *why*;
- **reusable success** → a non-trivial procedure worth repeating.

**Do NOT harvest** (this is the discipline cross-model testing showed models get wrong — both over- and under-firing): plain acknowledgements/thanks, ephemeral or general-knowledge questions (arithmetic, definitions, one-off lookups), chit-chat, or any task that produced **no new project-specific fact**. When unsure, re-apply the one-line test — if you would not retrieve this next session, skip.

Both directions are failures: an un-harvested genuine lesson doesn't compound, and a spurious harvest pollutes memory (and `write-gate` only filters *low-signal* noise, not *off-topic* writes). The one-line test is the gate. (Harvest logic lives in `wiki-memory`; this is the reflex that fires it — including on quick, unplanned tasks `plan-first-execute` never sees.)
