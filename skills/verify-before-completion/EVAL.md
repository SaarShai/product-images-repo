## A/B savings (output deltas N=50 × 5 prompts; judge only N=15 — N=50 judge pending), model=mimo-v2-flash

| metric | without skill | with skill | Δ | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| input tokens (mean)  | 118 | 326 | +176.6% | n/a |
| output tokens (mean) | 316 | 210 | -33.5% | n/a |
| latency (ms)         | 5349 | 4764 | n/a | n/a |
| judge score (0–5)    | 4.07 | 3.67 | **-0.40 (N=15 only)** | n/a |

> ⚠ The judge row is **N=15, not N=50**: the N=50 judge pass died on `MiMo 402: Insufficient balance` and was never re-run (see `eval/FINDINGS.md`). The committed `verify-before-completion.judged.json` is the N=15 partial. Treat −0.40 as a provisional, small-N signal (and a likely rubric artifact — the rubric scored "demands fresh evidence" below "affirms confidently"), not a settled N=50 result.

## Methodology

- Sample size: N=3-10 local smoke; N≥50 on Kaggle T4 for any >20% savings claim.
- Tasks: 3–5 representative prompts in `eval/tasks/verify-before-completion.yaml`.
- Backends supported: `ollama`, `anthropic`, `mimo`, `mlx` (`--backend` arg).
- Judge: Xiaomi MiMo via `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1` (preferred for quality) or local Ollama.
- Rubric: per-task rubric embedded in the YAML.
