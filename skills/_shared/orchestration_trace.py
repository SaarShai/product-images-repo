"""orchestration_trace — tiny append-only JSONL writer for per-lane dispatch
telemetry (usage/latency/served-model), consumed by model_roster.run_dispatch.

`correlation_id` is a bounded run identifier supplied by model_roster, not task
content or a task fingerprint. Parallel lane events in one panel share it;
independent dispatches get distinct IDs unless a caller deliberately supplies
one. This append-only sink does not reinterpret caller data.

PERSISTENCE MUST NOT CRASH A CALLER: record_lane_event never raises — any
failure (unwritable path, bad permissions, disk full) is caught and reported
as a False return, exactly like the CLI dispatch paths in model_roster.py that
drop a failing member rather than take down the whole panel.

Default trace path is `.brainer/trace/lanes.jsonl` (repo-root relative), the
same `.brainer/<tool>/...` convention output-filter's index.jsonl and
context-keeper's session archive already use — already covered by the repo's
`.brainer/` gitignore entry (verify with `git check-ignore`).

Redaction — COERCE-AND-REDACT WALK, then a final string-pass. This is the
third design; the two it replaces each leaked (2026-07-05 cross-vendor review,
three passes):

  1. A structure-walk that redacted values before coercion leaked 3 ways —
     dict KEYS were never scrubbed; a non-string value (bytes/object) whose
     `str()` yields a secret was only stringified by `json.dumps(default=str)`
     AFTER the scrub ran, so it bypassed redaction; the import-fail fallback
     only blanked string leaves.
  2. A pure final-string-pass (`json.dumps(default=str)` then redact the one
     serialized line) closed those, but JSON serialization MUTATES the secret
     text before the regex sees it, opening new bypasses: a secret containing
     `"` or a newline is escaped (`\"`, `\n`) so the token pattern no longer
     anchors; `ensure_ascii=True` turns a non-ASCII secret byte into a
     ``\\uXXXX`` escape which the pattern misses; a `bytes` value reprs with
     backslash artifacts.

The fix combines both so neither blind spot survives:

  a. Walk the event first. Coerce EVERY leaf to a raw string (bytes decoded,
     objects `str()`-ed) and redact it — and redact dict KEYS too — BEFORE any
     serialization. The regex therefore sees the secret with its natural
     boundaries (a `"` or newline is a clean token terminator, not an inserted
     backslash), catching the escaped-secret and non-ASCII cases pass 2 missed,
     and catching key/coerced-value secrets pass 1 missed.
  b. Serialize the already-redacted structure with `ensure_ascii=False` (no
     ``\\uXXXX`` escaping can re-hide a byte) and run `redact_secrets` over the
     line once more as belt-and-suspenders. Redaction is idempotent, so the
     second pass only ever catches something the walk somehow left.

This is a PERSISTENCE surface, not egress, but the same secret family (keys,
tokens, .env assignments) must never land in a trace file either.

Fails CLOSED: if the redactor cannot be imported there is no way to guarantee
the line is clean, so the event is dropped entirely — nothing is written,
`record_lane_event` returns False. A partial scrub is still a leak; we refuse
to write rather than write partially-redacted data.

Never-raises: the walk guards every coercion (`bytes.decode(errors="replace")`
never raises; `str()` and cycle/depth traversal are wrapped), and the whole
body is inside a try/except returning False. A circular reference is broken by
an id-based `seen` set (emits `[CIRCULAR]`), a pathologically deep structure by
a depth cap (`[TOO_DEEP]`), and a `__str__` that itself raises by the coercion
guard (`[UNSERIALIZABLE]`) — so an odd-shaped field is stored coerced, not
dropped, and nothing takes down the caller."""
