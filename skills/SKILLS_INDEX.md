# Brainer Skills

Lean skills for AI coding agents (Claude Code · Codex · Gemini) across four pillars: **(1)** token-use optimization, **(2)** context-window optimization & management, **(3)** LLM wiki-memory framework, **(4)** self-improvement & learning.

This replaces the old `start.md` boot doc. Each skill is a self-contained folder under `skills/<name>/`. Skill descriptions are the only thing always resident in the agent's context; full bodies load on trigger.

For measured per-skill deltas and the live A/B table see [`eval/FINDINGS.md`](../eval/FINDINGS.md). Twenty-four skills ship an `EVAL.md`; `baton`, `fable-mode`, and `propagate` currently do not.

## Catalog

| Skill | One-line |
|---|---|
| [caveman-ultra](caveman-ultra/SKILL.md) | Terse output style. Drops filler; preserves code/numbers/errors verbatim. |
| [plan-first-execute](plan-first-execute/SKILL.md) | Plan before non-trivial/spec-worthy tasks: separate WHAT from HOW, clarify load-bearing unknowns, derive tasks from acceptance criteria, then execute. |
| [think](think/SKILL.md) | How an agent should think: first-principles, reduce/simplify, research & borrow, experiment-to-falsify; ideation + 5-whys + pre-mortem/inversion. **Slash-only** (`/think`). |
| [lean-execution](lean-execution/SKILL.md) | Prune plans/scope to the smallest safe path. |
| [verify-before-completion](verify-before-completion/SKILL.md) | Run fresh verification before claiming done. |
| [wiki-memory](wiki-memory/SKILL.md) | Repo-local markdown wiki: progressive retrieval + gated writes. |
| [prompt-triage](prompt-triage/SKILL.md) | Pre-model classifier hook; routes simple tasks to cheap models. |
| [context-keeper](context-keeper/SKILL.md) | PreCompact hook: structured memory before compaction. |
| [semantic-diff](semantic-diff/SKILL.md) | AST-node diff on file re-reads (95%+ savings; slim Bash CLI default ~9-18M, optional MCP). |
| [index-first](index-first/SKILL.md) | Prefer pre-built indexes / composite verbs over grep+read chains; batch N related lookups into one capped call. |
| [output-filter](output-filter/SKILL.md) | Strip ANSI/progress/dup noise from terminal output; content-aware search/log/diff summaries keep raw output recoverable via archive id / `rewind --grep`. |
| [compliance-canary](compliance-canary/SKILL.md) | UserPromptSubmit hook: the **single always-on drift watcher**. Four mechanisms in one process — symptomatic per-skill probes, a periodic skill-rule re-anchor, a request ledger, and a correction ledger. The re-anchor yields to a fired probe; closeout ledgers remain visible until completed or user-closed. Absorbed `skill-pulse` (v1.10). Ships an offline `measure.py`. **Default-on since v1.7** (the cross-model longrun measured the original probe/re-anchor pair: +0.44 / +0.27, 2 model families). |
| [write-gate](write-gate/SKILL.md) | Content-quality gate before persistent writes. Signal-score (decisions / errors / architecture / code / numbers, minus filler / speculation) + why-clause enforcement for decisions. Lineage: ogham-mcp + codenamev/claude_memory. |
| [wiki-refresh](wiki-refresh/SKILL.md) | Reconcile wiki pages against the current codebase (Keep/Update/Consolidate/Replace/Delete); code-grounded via `audit-refs`, emits typed `contradicts:` edges. Ground-truth reconcile. Lineage: [EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) (`plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-compound-refresh`). |
| [cache-lint](cache-lint/SKILL.md) | Static audit against Anthropic's 6 prompt-cache rules — dynamic content above breakpoint, prefix mutation by Stop-hooks, model switching, breakpoint sizing — with report-only `suggested_action` hints, plus a rule-7 tool-surface audit (resident-but-unused MCP servers, transcript-mined; minimal-tool-surface principle). Lineage: ussumant/cache-audit. |
| [task-retrospective](task-retrospective/SKILL.md) | User-triggered task audit mode for repeatable project work: arm before the task or reconstruct after the fact, produce a project-learning report, and route ≤3 durable lessons to the narrowest project-owned target (memory, SOP, checklist, project-specific skill, or broad agent instruction) through `write-gate`. It does not audit Brainer skill obedience or edit canonical Brainer skills. |
| [brainer-audit](brainer-audit/SKILL.md) | Report-only Brainer skill-use audit mode: inspect normalized events for missed skill triggers, unverified completion claims, write-gate bypasses, task-retrospective boundary violations, dropped requirements, and output-filter opportunities. Claude/Codex hooks are opt-in and marker-gated; Antigravity uses lower-fidelity sidecar snapshots. Proposes Brainer improvements but does not apply them. |
| [loop-engineering](loop-engineering/SKILL.md) | Design the verifier, not the prompt. Chooses the loop SHAPE (open/closed · inner/outer · single/fleet), pre-flights the harness underneath it (context/tools/permissions/hooks/subagents/skills/memory), adds a loop memory contract (`anchor_files` / `state_store` / `recall` / `writeback` / `state_concurrency`), and wires a generator to a SEPARATE verifier — the net-new layer no other skill provides. Ships `loop_lint.py`: a static gate that refuses a loop spec with no gate / no stop+budget / generator==verifier (self-grading; also catches same-actor-different-verb, human-approval gates, missing long-loop memory, fleet state without concurrency, and unattended specs with no `on_error` failure policy), plus `loop_run_monitor.py`: a runtime trace gate for stuck/costly loops. Delegates the verify reflex→`verify-before-completion`, the learning loop→`task-retrospective`, the closed-loop plan→`plan-first-execute`, restraint→`lean-execution`. **Default-installed** (v1.11; previously opt-in pending N≥50 — promoted on user request, its loop gates are load-bearing CI value). Lineage: the "design the verifier" generator-verifier framing (ReAct/Reflexion) + pattern sources HarnessCode (yzddp) & autonomy-loop (inferencegod). |
| [eval-gate](eval-gate/SKILL.md) | LLM-as-judge quality gate for AI output: score a draft / post / answer / agent reply against a written rubric before it ships — returns 0–5 + reason, exit code gates, every caught failure becomes a permanent case. The output-side complement to `loop-engineering` (which designs the loop's verifier) and `verify-before-completion` (which runs deterministic checks); eval-gate is the *judgment* check where "good enough" has no test. **Default-installed** (v1.11; previously opt-in, 79% judge–human agreement with N≥50 validation pending — promoted on user request). |
| [baton](baton/SKILL.md) | Session handoff: drop/grab a single verified handoff file in `.brainer/baton/` — intent, git-verified State of Play, dead-ends-with-why, literal next step. Iron Rule: state built from `git status`, never chat narrative. Vendored from [blader/baton](https://github.com/blader/baton) (MIT) via `/learn`; **proposed, slash-only** (`/baton`) until telemetry promotes. Ships a `prompt_intent` canary probe on handoff/resume phrases. |
| [learn-skill](learn-skill/SKILL.md) | Brainer's `/learn`: ingest a pointed-at source (dir / doc URL / a workflow you just did / pasted notes) into a **proposed** skill — prompt-only over existing tools (WebFetch/Read/Grep), dedup-before-write (desc + body-code scan, PATCH=abort not merge), rationale gated by `write-gate`, born `disable-model-invocation: true` (slash-only, can't auto-fire). Promotion is **telemetry-gated** (`telemetry.py` records hit/abort, recorded or transcript-mined; `learn.py promote` flips `proposed → trusted` once usage clears the gate) — not author-granted. Port of [Hermes `/learn`](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skills). **Opt-in** (`auto-install: false`). |
| [requirements-ledger](requirements-ledger/SKILL.md) | Nothing the user said gets dropped. Decomposes every user message into ATOMIC items (asks / questions / constraints / conjuncts / implicit asks) into a USER-VISIBLE markdown ledger (`.brainer/ledger/<sid>.md`) as the hard source of truth; mirrors open items into the native task list on Claude Code; reconciles every item and ASKS before closing (never self-closes). Enforced mechanically by `compliance-canary`: the `ledger_not_materialized` probe + the `completion_without_closure` gate + the request-ledger cross-check (coarse hidden capture audits the visible atomic file). **Default-installed.** |
| [impact-of-change](impact-of-change/SKILL.md) | Map a code edit to its blast radius before committing — parses `git diff` for changed symbols, reverse-traverses graphify's `calls` + `inherits` edges (callers + subclasses, depth≤3) for inbound dependents, emits a LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk score; degrades to a labelled lexical grep when graphify is absent. Tells `verify-before-completion` WHAT to verify (forward impact only). **Opt-in** (`auto-install: false`). |
| [propagate](propagate/SKILL.md) | Push canonical skill changes to the sibling/consumer repos: per-sibling classify → `--apply-stale`/`--apply-absent` → sibling `install.sh` → verify → `--post-check`, sequentially. STALE (byte-matches canonical history) fast-forwards; CUSTOMIZED (sibling-local work) is never overwritten — flagged for manual merge. Canonical must be committed first. Fires mechanically on "propagate/sync to siblings" via its `prompt_intent` probe. |
| [security-oversight](security-oversight/SKILL.md) | Pre-ship security triage of a `git diff` — flags INTRODUCED risk in added lines across 4 OWASP-anchored classes (secret / injection / supply_chain / authz), scores HIGH/MEDIUM/REVIEW, routes HIGH/MEDIUM to `verify-before-completion` and surfaces REVIEW for a human; scanner-aware (recommends gitleaks/semgrep/osv-scanner), never blocks, absence ≠ proof of safety. The security sibling of `impact-of-change`. It also **audits an untrusted skill folder/repo pre-install** (`skill_audit.py` → PASS/WARN/FAIL); A18 dogfood permits deliberate WARN fixtures but fails CRITICAL/HIGH findings outside test files. Lineage: OWASP Agentic Top 10 (ASI) + LLM Top 10 + Karpathy's agentic-engineering mandate. **Opt-in** (`auto-install: false`). |
| [team-lead](team-lead/SKILL.md) | Frontier-as-leader orchestration protocol — when a top-tier model drives, it PLANS / DELEGATES to cheap `builder` lanes / REVIEWS via a cold `verifier`, never types keystrokes. Roster ladder + self-contained brief contract + cold-verify-every-claim + proportionality gate. Upstreamed from screenery-lean's "Self-improving (FABLE)" session (2026-07-05); cost doctrine lives in `_shared/ORCHESTRATION.md §6`. Ships the `builder`/`verifier` agent defs. **Default** (prose-only, no hook). |
| [fable-mode](fable-mode/SKILL.md) | Fable 5's working discipline as a loadable method skill for cheaper seats (Opus/Sonnet): five gates in order — scope (define done + its check) → evidence (open the real thing, never design from memory) → adversarial reasoning (attack your own answer; 2 failed fixes = wrong diagnosis) → verify at the layer of the claim → report calibrated (verified vs assumed) — plus standing habits and gate-skip smells. Fires proactively on layered/stalling tasks or on "fable mode" / "slow down and do this right". Method-only: changes execution of the current task, produces no files. **Default** (prose-only, no hook). |
| [standing-orders](standing-orders/SKILL.md) | Auto-arm standing directives on matching prompts — ORCH tier (goal, lanes, cheapest delegation, other-vendor advisor, end-to-end) on decomposable work; DEEP tier (blindspot pass, lesson capture) on high-level tasks. Fires on compliance-canary probes; pulse re-anchor resists drift. |

28 skills total — all **listed and symlinked by the current installer**. Opt-in status controls whether a skill's installer auto-wires hooks or dependencies, not whether its text is available. `compliance-canary` runs four mechanisms in one hook; its published long-run uplift applies to the original probe/re-anchor pair, while the request and correction ledgers are mechanically tested. `loop-engineering` and `eval-gate` are default-installed for their load-bearing gates even though their N≥50 model validation remains pending. `think` stays manual-only (`/think`, `disable-model-invocation: true`) because its frontier A/B was posture-neutral. Promotion history and measured deltas live in [`eval/FINDINGS.md`](../eval/FINDINGS.md).

Removed after measurement: `personal-assistant` / `memory-api` / `skill-creator` (v1.1.0, redundancy), `delegate` (v1.2.0, zero measured gain — auto-routing via `prompt-triage` already covers the use case), `context-refresh` (v1.3.0, merged into `handoff` — its only unique piece was the auto-launcher which never worked reliably; the rest is now `/handoff --full` and `/handoff --ask`), `handoff-from` + `memory-decay` (v1.6.0, redundant / verified no-op), and `compress-context` + `session-recall` + `loop-breaker` (v1.6.0, the unproven-gain tail: each was both ❌/🟡 on measured benefit and redundant with a kept skill — `caveman`+`context-keeper`, `context-keeper`+`wiki`+`handoff`, and host loop-protection respectively; see `eval/FINDINGS.md` "Catalog cuts"), and `handoff` (v1.6.1 — operational-only, no measured gain; the host's `/compact` + `context-keeper` PreCompact extraction cover session continuity).

External integrations: [`index-first`](index-first/SKILL.md) and [`wiki-memory`](wiki-memory/SKILL.md) recognize [graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) (`graphify-out/graph.json`) when present — graphify owns the auto-extracted *what/how/connected* layer; wiki-memory owns the curated *why/decision* layer. See each skill's body for the exact protocol.

## Most-recommended stack

The eight slots below cover the measured-win axes (output × routing × memory × retrieval × re-read × terminal × done-claims). Each skill earns its slot with a measured number; numbers compose across axes, diminish within. Per-axis sources in [`eval/FINDINGS.md`](../eval/FINDINGS.md).

| Slot | Skill | Headline measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Output style | [`caveman-ultra`](caveman-ultra/SKILL.md) + [`lean-execution`](lean-execution/SKILL.md) | **−87.7%** output (combo) |
| Routing | [`prompt-triage`](prompt-triage/SKILL.md) | −20.9% total, 100% accuracy |
| Memory across compaction | [`context-keeper`](context-keeper/SKILL.md) | 97.7% transcript compression |
| Retrieval — what/how/connected | external: [graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) | **−93%** vs grep+read at parity evidence (`graphify explain`) |
| Retrieval — why/decision | [`wiki-memory`](wiki-memory/SKILL.md) | 100% evidence on project-history questions; combo with graphify: −87% vs grep at 100% evidence |
| Re-reads | [`semantic-diff`](semantic-diff/SKILL.md) | 95.5% reduction on unchanged re-reads |
| Terminal output | [`output-filter`](output-filter/SKILL.md) | −88.8% bytes, errors preserved |
| Claims of done | [`verify-before-completion`](verify-before-completion/SKILL.md) | −33.5% output, evidence-first |

Bootstrap once per project: `python3 skills/wiki-memory/tools/wiki.py init && graphify extract .` (graphify is auto-installed by `./install.sh`; pass `--no-graphify` to opt out).

## Prime directive

- **Caveman-Ultra by default** for emitted prose. Reasoning budget separate.
- **Plan-first** for non-trivial tasks.
- **Lean execution**: smallest reversible action.
- **Verify before claiming done**.
- **Retrieve before reasoning** about project/wiki facts — prefer `graphify explain` for code questions, `wiki-memory` for decision questions.
- **Use cheapest capable worker**; keep main context clean. Dispatch speaks in capability **tiers**, resolved to the newest in-host (or clearly-better reachable) model at dispatch time — doctrine in [`_shared/ORCHESTRATION.md`](_shared/ORCHESTRATION.md).

Stacking, anti-patterns, and workload guidance live in [`eval/FINDINGS.md`](../eval/FINDINGS.md) — not always-loaded; read once when installing or tuning the catalog.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh             # symlink to all four host loaders
./install.sh --host claude-code   # just one host
```

## Status

Twenty-four skills ship an `EVAL.md`; method/operational skills without one are named above. Skills claiming >20% savings get N≥50 Kaggle-T4 verification before being promoted to default. The opt-in mechanism remains supported: a skill carrying `auto-install: false` in its SKILL.md frontmatter is symlinked and listed by `install.sh` but its `tools/install.sh` is not run, so it never auto-wires a hook or pulls a heavy dependency (`baton`, `brainer-audit`, `impact-of-change`, `index-first`, `learn-skill`, and `security-oversight` are opt-in today; `compliance-canary` graduated to default at v1.7, `loop-engineering` + `eval-gate` at v1.11). To **disable** a hook skill: per-skill installers append to `.claude/settings.json` and never delete, so remove the stale hook entry from `.claude/settings.json` by hand.
